Something I'm working on. Hooks up to Ollama and uses an LLM as a game master. Code is shite right now, because I suck at coding - and still needs a lot of work...

Install Ollama and make sure you have world-map.py pointing to the right port;

 ```self.ollama_url = "http://localhost:11434/api/generate"```

I'm using Mistral:7b for this, but I might switch to something smaller.
